            <h4>
                Otters are very cute and unique creatures that can live in both
                fresh and salt water. These animals are carnivorous and tend to
                eat many aquatic creatures such as frogs, fish, turtles,
                crayfish, and other small mammals. However, even if their plate
                may seem rather intimidating, they're actually quite lovable, as
                some even hold hands to help each other from drifting away while
                sleeping! Other times, they'll cover their eyes while they sleep
                so as to not be bothered by the sunlight.

            <h4>
                Otters are one of the cutest animals in my opinion. They manage
                to be fun and friendly when domesticated, often playing with
                basketballs or other spherical objects in an attempt to exert
                their energy. Often, otter owners will let otters break ice to
                replicate the feeling of cracking clams or oysters with a rock
                while in the wild.
