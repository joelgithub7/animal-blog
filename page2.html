            <h2>Habitat</h2>
            <h4>Otters have a very specific climate and habitat that is necessary and vital to their care. They require a tropical climate, with a temperature from 75-85 degrees Fahrenheit and both a dry area and a pool/wet area. They cannot just have one as if they are in the pool for too long, they can develop health problems. Additionally, your enclosure must be roofed as they tend to climb, a lot and you must have either a sandpit or dirt around for them to dig which they love to do.</h4>

            <h2>Diet</h2>
            <h4>Otters do not have that complex of a diet, as they have one that can be comparable to a cat's. Many sources suggest cat food as a base; however, to lean more into meats later on such as fish, poultry, and other meats as it is essential that these are over 50% of their diet. Fish, vegetables, soft-boiled eggs, and insects are also highly recommended for otters to receive a balanced diet and to receive all the minerals and vitamins integral to their survival.</h4>
